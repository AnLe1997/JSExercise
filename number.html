        <div>
            <p><strong>1.</strong> Write a Java program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. <br>
                In number system, ugly numbers are positive numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. First 10 ugly numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12. By convention, 1 is included. <br>
                Test Date:Input an integer number: 235 <br>
                <em>Expected Output</em> :</p>
                <pre>It is not an ugly number.</pre>        
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>2.</strong> Write a Java program to generate and show all Kaprekar numbers less than 1000. <br>
                <em>Expected Output</em> :</p>
                <pre>
                1       1         0 + 1                                  
                9       81        8 + 1

                8 Kaprekar numbers.  
                </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>3.</strong> Write a Java program to check whether a given number is a happy number or unhappy number. <br>
            Happy number: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1, or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.<br>
            An unhappy number is a number that is not happy.<br>
            The first few unhappy numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20.</p>
            <p><em>Expected Output</em></p>
            <pre>
            Input a number: 5                                                       
            Unhappy Number</pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>4.</strong> Write a Java program to check whether a given number is a Disarium number or unhappy number. <br>
                A Disarium number is a number defined by the following process :<br>
                Sum of its digits powered with their respective position is equal to the original number.<br>
                For example 175 is a Disarium number :<br>
                As 1<sup>1</sup>+3<sup>2</sup>+5<sup>3</sup> = 135<br>
                Some other DISARIUM are 89, 175, 518 etc.<br>
                A number will be called Disarium if the sum of its digits powered with their respective position is equal with the number itself. Sample Input: 135.<br>
                </p>
                <p><em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre>
                Input a number : 25                                                     
                Not a Disarium Number.</pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>5.</strong> Write a Java program to check whether a number is a Pronic Number or Heteromecic Number or not. <br>
                A pronic number is a number which is the product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of the form n(n + 1).<br>
                The first few pronic numbers are:<br>
                0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 156, 182, 210, 240, 272, 306, 342, 380, 420, 462 … etc.</p>
                <p><em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre> 
                a number : 110 
                Pronic Number.</pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>6.</strong> Write a Java program check whether a number is an Automorphic number or not. <br>
                In mathematics, an automorphic number is a number whose square "ends" in the same digits as the number itself. For example, 5<sup>2</sup> = 25, 6<sup>2</sup> = 36, 76<sup>2</sup> = 5776, and 890625<sup>2</sup> = 793212890625, so 5, 6, 76 and 890625 are all automorphic numbers.<br>
                <em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre>
                Input a number : 76                                                   
                Automorphic Number.
                </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>7.</strong> Write a Java program to check if a given number is circular prime or not. <br>Circular Prime : A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime.<br>
                For example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime. A circular prime with at least two digits can only consist of combinations of the digits 1, 3, 7 or 9, because having 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 as the last digit makes the number divisible by 2, and having 0 or 5 as the last digit makes it divisible by 5.<br>
                Input Data:<br>
                Input a number: 35<br>
                <em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre>It is not a Circular Prime number.
                </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>8.</strong> Write a Java program to check a number is a cube or not. <br>
                In arithmetic and algebra, the cube of a number n is its third power: the result of the number multiplied by itself twice:<br>
                n<sup>3</sup> = n × n × n.<br>
                Input Data:<br>
                Input a number: 8 <br>
                <em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre>Number is a cube.
                </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>9.</strong> Write a Java program to find all the narcissistic numbers between 1 and 1000. <br>
                In number theory, a narcissistic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.<br>
                For example:<br>
                153 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup></p>
                <em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre>1                                                      
                2                                                      
                3                                                      
                4                                                      
                5                                                      
                6                                                      
                7                                                      
                8                                                      
                9                                                      
                153                                                    
                370                                                    
                371                                                    
                407
                </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>10.</strong> Write a Program in Java to check whether a number is an Armstrong Number or not. <br>
                Armstrong (Michael F. Armstrong) number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers<br>
                <em>Expected Output</em></p>
                <pre>Input an integer:  153
