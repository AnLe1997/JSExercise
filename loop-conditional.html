            <p><strong>7.</strong> Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3 print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print &quot;Buzz&quot;.
                For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>8.</strong> According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process :
                <br>&quot;Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers
                for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)&quot;.
                <br>Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers. 
            </p>
        </div>    
        <div>
            <p><strong>9. </strong>Write a JavaScript program to find the armstrong numbers of 3 digits.
                <br>Note : An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> = 371.

            <p><strong>10. </strong>Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
            </p>

            *  
            * *
